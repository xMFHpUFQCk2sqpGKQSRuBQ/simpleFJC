# simpleFJC

A simple implementation of the Freely-Joint Chain algorithtm
using cython, numba, and numpy

## Install

Using conda environment is ( _probably_ ) not required, but recommended<br>
As I test in conda (Miniconda3), there is a slight chance it having issues in pure python  


### requirements:

Installation requires python3 and the following modules:

* cython
* numba
* numpy
* logging
* functools

### recommended

* conda environment
* matplotlib - to generate images

### Windows
cython requires a c/c++ compiler. Visual Studio Community Edition is freely available from Microsoft and is supported by cython.

# Examples

Contains the python script used to generate the FJC figures for the paper:


# Chain algorithms:

(NYI - not yet implemented)

* Gaussian approximation
* Fuirer integral form    - NYI
* Worm-like chain         - NYI
* Elastic FJC             - NYI
